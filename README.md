irismvc
=======

IrisMVC is an OOP PHP framework that developers can use as a strong and secure foundation to build on various web applications following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It provides the basic functionality developers need, without reinventing the wheel, so the learning curve is dramatically short and they should be able to start using it at full capacity in days.
