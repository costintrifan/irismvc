## Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------
Before using IrisMVC 3.0 please make sure your server meets the following requirements:

    * Apache 2+ (mod_rewrite enabled)
    * PHP 5+
    * sys-logs directory must be writable
    * sys-temp directory must be writable (if used)


## Changes
-----------------------------------------------
Since the last release the framework has been heavily revised and improved. This means that many features that were
available in version 2.0 might not exist or work as expected in this release.

If you have used this framework on your website please install it and test it locally before updating your live server!
